### Hostname and DNS

The server hostname is `subdomain.domain.tld`. Once the VPS was provisioned, I created an A record with my DNS provider, pointing `subdomain.domain.tld` to the allocated public IP address.

I then connected to the VPS via SSH using Windows Terminal:

```
ssh root@subdomain.domain.tld
```

### Updates

The first step was to update package repositories and install any available updates:

```
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

In this case, there were no pending updates.

___
### Create Sudo User

After confirming the system was up to date, I created a new sudo-capable user:

```
adduser user
```

When prompted, I set a password and skipped the additional optional fields (Full Name, Room Number, etc.). After that, I added the user to the sudo group:

```
usermod -aG sudo user
```

To verify sudo access, I disconnected the root SSH session, reconnected using the new account, and switched to root:

```
su root
```

Root access worked successfully. If this fails, it typically indicates the user was not correctly added to the sudo group.

___
### Create a Backup Sudo User

As a precaution, I created a second sudo user for recovery or testing:

```
sudo adduser backupuser
```

I followed the same verification process as above.

___
### Disable Root Login

With two sudo users in place, I reset the root password:

```
sudo passwd root
```

After confirming the password updated correctly by logging in via SSH, I edited the SSH configuration file:

```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Under the **Authentication** section, I changed:

`PermitRootLogin yes` to `PermitRootLogin no`

I then saved the file and restarted SSH:

```
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

Root login over SSH is now disabled.

### Fail2ban Setup & Configuration

Install Fail2ban:

```
sudo apt install fail2ban
```

Create a local configuration file:

```
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Edit the configuration:

```
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Make the below changes:

```
bantime = 168h
findtime = 24h
maxretyr = 3
```

After making configuration changes, start and enable Fail2ban:

```
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```

___
### Firewall Installation & Configuration

Next, I installed UFW:

```
sudo apt install ufw
```

It was already installed, so the package manager simply checked for updates. I then checked which ports were open:

```
sudo ss -topln
```

Only ports 53 (DNS) and 22 (SSH) were open. To confirm UFW status:

```
sudo ufw status
```

Since no rules were configured yet, UFW was inactive. This is generally a good point to review open ports and restrict anything unnecessary.

Before continuing, I enabled and started UFW:

```
sudo systemctl start ufw
sudo systemctl enable ufw
```

___
### Unattended Upgrades

To ensure the system receives security updates automatically, I installed unattended upgrades:

```
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
```

Then configured it using:

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
```

When prompted, I confirmed the configuration.

___
### Time Zone

To ensure the system was set to the correct time zone, I ran:

```
cat /etc/timezone
```

Which produced:
`Etc/UTC`

I changed it to `Africa/Johannesburg` using:

```
sudo nano /etc/timezone
```

After changing the time zone, I rebooted the server.
