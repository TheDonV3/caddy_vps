### Purpose

This VPS is intended to host non-WordPress websites using Caddy. The initial motivation for this project was to migrate my own website away from Webflow and move to a self-managed hosting environment.

___
### Provider Choice

I selected Absolute Hosting based on consistently positive experience with their platform. Their pricing, performance, and support have been noticeably better than other providers I’ve used.

___
### Operating System

Ubuntu 24.04 was chosen as the operating system due to familiarity, stability, and the strength of its ecosystem. It remains one of the most widely documented and well-supported Linux distributions, making it a reliable foundation for this setup.

___
### Resource Allocation

Since this VPS is currently intended to host a single website and support documentation/testing, the resources were intentionally kept modest. The server is provisioned as follows:

- 2 vCPU (AMD EPYC Milan 7763)
- 2 GB DDR4 RAM
- 20 GB SSD storage
- 1 VPS backup slot
- 1 public IPv4 address
- 500 Mbps network speed
