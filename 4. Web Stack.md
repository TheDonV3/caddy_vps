### Why Caddy?

The initial motivation for this project was to migrate my personal website away from Webflow and move to a self-managed hosting environment. During the research phase, I came across the following resource, which demonstrates deploying a static Webflow export using Caddy on an EC2 instance:

After evaluating Caddy, I selected it due to its simplicity, automatic HTTPS support, performance, and the clarity of its configuration model. It provides an efficient and lightweight solution for hosting static sites and reverse proxying future applications if needed.

### Caddy Installation

Caddy was installed using the official package repository, following the steps outlined in the Caddy documentation. This process adds the Caddy repository, updates apt, and installs the package.

Installation command:

```
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list sudo chmod o+r /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg sudo chmod o+r /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list sudo apt update sudo apt install caddy
```

To verify the installation:

```
caddy
```

The command returns the Caddy CLI help output, confirming a successful installation.

### Configuration

Once installed, the default Caddyfile was updated with the following configuration:

```
subdomain.domain.tld {
        # Set this path to your site's directory.
        root * /usr/share/caddy

        # Enable the static file server.
        file_server

        # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
        # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

        # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
        # php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
```

The Caddy service was then reloaded for the configuration to take effect:

```
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

Visiting `subdomain.domain.tld` now displays the default “Caddy works!” page, confirming that the service is running correctly.

### Customization

After confirming that Caddy was operating correctly, the default `index.html` page was replaced with a custom version.

The new HTML file and logo were transferred to the VPS:

```
scp .\index.html user@subdomain.domain.tld:/home/user scp .\logo.png user@subdomain.domain.tld:/home/user
```

An SSH authenticity warning appeared due to host verification changes made during the SSH hardening process. Clearing the affected entry in `known_hosts` resolved the issue. Once resolved, the transferred files were confirmed to be present on the server.

The default index page was then renamed:

```
sudo mv /usr/share/caddy/index.html /usr/share/caddy/index.html.old
```

The custom files were moved into place:

```
sudo mv ~/index.html /usr/share/caddy/ sudo mv ~/logo.png /usr/share/caddy/
```

Finally, Caddy was reloaded to apply the changes:

```
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

The site now successfully serves the custom static page.
