### Webflow Export

To deploy the static version of my site, the first step was to export the content from Webflow. Following the approach outlined here:

[https://hackanooga.com/post/quickly-convert-webflow-to-static-site/](https://hackanooga.com/post/quickly-convert-webflow-to-static-site/)

I used `wget` to recursively download the site and prepare the static files:

```
sudo wget --recursive --no-clobber --page-requisites --html-extension --convert-links --domains site.webflow.io --no-parent https://site.webflow.io/
```

This process generated a sub-directory containing the exported static assets.

Once the download completed, the directory was renamed to match the production domain:

```
sudo mv site.webflow.io domain.tld
```

### Configuration

After confirming that the exported files were downloaded correctly, the Caddy configuration was updated to serve the new static site. The following entry was added to the Caddyfile:

```
domain.tld {
        # Set this path to your site's directory.
        root * /usr/share/caddy/domain.tld/

        # Enable the static file server.
        file_server

        # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
        # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

        # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
        # php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
```

Caddy was then reloaded to apply the configuration:

```
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

### DNS Changes

The A record for `domain.tld` was updated to point to the VPS public IP address. Within a few minutes, the site was accessible using the new hosting environment, with a valid TLS certificate automatically issued by Let’s Encrypt.
